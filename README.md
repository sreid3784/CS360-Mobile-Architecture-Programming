Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements were to develop a weight tracking app that allowed users to perform basic create, read, update and delete actions on their weight data. We also needed to have a login page, and allow for SMS notifications to the users. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens needed were a login screen, a main page, and a database screen where users could see their previous entries. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My approach was I drew the screens out in powerpoint and with those sketches I designed my UI. These were pretty basic and could be replicated in the future. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested my code by using the emulator - this allowed me to see how my layouts would look on an actual phone screen. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
There were challenges everywhere, I got behind and never could catch up - I'm not a very strong programmer at all and am hoping to be able to learn on the job in some way. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was most successful in my designs and ideas before I started coding it. I knew what needed to be in there, the high level requirements behind it, who my users were etc...
